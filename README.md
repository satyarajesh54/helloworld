Branches are used for making bug fixes and feature work separate from our master branch.When feature or fix is ready the brach is merged with our master branch


Open a Pull Request
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you make a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone pull in your contribution - aka merge them into their branch. GitHub’s Pull Request feature allows you to compare the content on two branches. The changes, additions and subtractions, are shown in green and red and called diffs (differences).

As soon as you make a change, you can open a Pull Request. People use Pull Requests to start a discussion about commits (code review) even before the code is finished. This way you can get feedback as you go or help when you’re stuck.

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open, as we’re doing here, a Pull Request in your own repository and merge it yourself. It’s a great way to learn to process before working on larger projects.
